# rDNA_mine
**rDNAmine is a toolkit designed for working with long genomic repeats.**

## Introduction

A flagship example of such sequences is ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, which are stored in eukaryotic genomes as arrays of repeats ranging from a few to several hundred copies. These repeats are highly similar, and the length of a single module exceeds 9,000 base pairs. Using this tool, sequences of repeats can be isolated from reads obtained through Oxford Nanopore's direct DNA sequencing. 

The isolated repeats are aligned to a reference sequence and subsequently converted into a tabular format to facilitate further analysis in the R environment.
